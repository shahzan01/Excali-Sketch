# Excali Sketch

Excali Sketch is a real-time collaborative canvas application inspired by Excalidraw. Built entirely using a raw canvas library, it features custom shapes and text logic implemented from scratchâ€”no external drawing libraries required.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Uses WebSockets with an Express backend to enable seamless multi-user drawing sessions.
- **Custom Shapes & Text:** Implements unique drawing features with custom shapes and text logic for enhanced performance.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js and managed via Turborepo for efficient monorepo management. The frontend is deployed on Vercel and the backend on Render.
- **Room Management:** Easily create, join, and manage collaborative drawing sessions.
